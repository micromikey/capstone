# 🚀 HikeThere - Railway Deployment SUCCESS!

## ✅ Deployment Complete!

**Date:** October 5, 2025  
**Branch:** railway-deployment  
**Platform:** Railway.app  
**Region:** asia-southeast1

---

## 📊 Deployment Summary

### **What Was Deployed:**
- ✅ Laravel 12 Application (PHP 8.2)
- ✅ Nginx Web Server
- ✅ MySQL Database (Railway managed)
- ✅ Redis Cache (optional)
- ✅ ML Recommender Service
- ✅ Supervisor (manages PHP-FPM + Workers)

### **Build Method:**
- **Builder:** Dockerfile
- **Root Directory:** HikeThere
- **Build Time:** ~3-5 minutes
- **Container:** PHP 8.2-FPM + Nginx + Supervisor

---

## 🔑 Key Configuration Changes

### **Issues Resolved:**

1. **Builder Detection Issue** ✅
   - Problem: Railway using Railpack (Node.js) instead of Dockerfile
   - Solution: Set Root Directory to `HikeThere` in Railway settings

2. **PHP Not Found Errors** ✅
   - Problem: Startup commands running outside container
   - Solution: Used Dockerfile CMD instead of Railway startCommand

3. **Port Configuration** ✅
   - Problem: Hardcoded port 8080
   - Solution: Created railway-start.sh with dynamic PORT variable

4. **File Paths** ✅
   - Problem: railway.json not detected
   - Solution: Removed dockerfilePath, let Railway auto-detect

## ⚙️ Environment Variables Setup

### **Critical Variables to Set:**

```env
# Application
APP_KEY=base64:...              # Generate with: php artisan key:generate
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
APP_URL=https://your-app.up.railway.app
APP_TIMEZONE=Asia/Manila

DB_PORT=${{MYSQL_PORT}}
DB_DATABASE=${{MYSQL_DATABASE}}
DB_USERNAME=${{MYSQL_USER}}
DB_PASSWORD=${{MYSQL_PASSWORD}}

# Session & Cache
SESSION_DRIVER=database
CACHE_STORE=database
QUEUE_CONNECTION=database

# Filesystem
FILESYSTEM_DISK=local           # Change to 'gcs' for production

# Mail
MAIL_MAILER=log                 # Change to SMTP for production

## 🗄️ Database Setup

### **Option 1: Railway MySQL (Recommended)**

1. In Railway Dashboard, click **+ New** → **Database** → **Add MySQL**
2. Railway automatically links the database
3. Environment variables are auto-populated
4. Migrations run automatically on deployment

### **Option 2: External MySQL**

Set these variables manually:
```env
DB_HOST=your-external-host
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=hikethere
DB_USERNAME=your-user
DB_PASSWORD=your-password
```

---

## 📤 File Upload Configuration

### **For Production (Recommended):**

Use **Google Cloud Storage**:

1. Create GCS bucket in Google Cloud Console
2. Create service account with Storage Admin role
3. Download JSON key file
4. Add to Railway:

```env
FILESYSTEM_DISK=gcs
GCS_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
GCS_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
GCS_KEY_FILE=/app/storage/gcs-credentials.json
```

5. Upload credentials file to Railway or use environment variable

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **Application Not Loading:**
1. Check Railway logs for errors
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Check database connection

### **Database Connection Failed:**
1. Verify MySQL service is running
2. Check DB_* environment variables
3. Test connection: `php artisan migrate:status`

### **File Uploads Not Working:**
1. Check storage permissions (should be 777)
2. Verify FILESYSTEM_DISK setting
3. For GCS, check credentials

### **502 Bad Gateway:**
1. Check if PHP-FPM is running
2. Verify Nginx configuration
3. Check supervisord logs

## 📝 Important Files

### **railway.json**
```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "DOCKERFILE"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10,
    "healthcheckPath": "/up",

## 🎯 Production Recommendations

### **Security:**
1. ✅ Set `APP_DEBUG=false`
2. ✅ Use HTTPS (Railway provides free SSL)
3. ✅ Configure CSP headers
4. ✅ Enable rate limiting
5. ✅ Use strong database passwords

### **Performance:**
1. ✅ Enable Redis caching (add Redis service)
2. ✅ Use queue workers for background jobs
3. ✅ Enable OPcache (already in Dockerfile)
4. ✅ Use CDN for static assets
5. ✅ Optimize images before upload

### **Monitoring:**
1. ✅ Set up error tracking (Sentry, Bugsnag)
2. ✅ Monitor uptime (UptimeRobot, Pingdom)
3. ✅ Set up log aggregation
4. ✅ Configure alerts for errors

### **Backups:**
1. ✅ Enable automated database backups (Railway provides this)
2. ✅ Backup uploaded files to separate location
3. ✅ Document recovery procedures
