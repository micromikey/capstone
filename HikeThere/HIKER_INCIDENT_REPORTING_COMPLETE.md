# Hiker Safety Incident Reporting System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully restructured the safety incident system from organization-managed to **hiker-reported**. Hikers can now report safety incidents they encounter while on trails.

---

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Report Incident Button on Trail Page** ✅
- **Location**: `resources/views/trails/show.blade.php`
- **Feature**: Added "Report Safety Issue" button (red warning icon) next to Book Trail, Build Itinerary, and Favorite buttons
- **Access**: Only visible to authenticated hikers
- **Functionality**: Opens a modal for incident reporting

### 2. **Incident Report Modal** ✅
- **Interactive Form Fields**:
  - **Incident Type**: Dropdown (injury, accident, hazard, wildlife, weather, equipment, other)
  - **Severity**: 4 levels (low, medium, high, critical)
  - **Location**: Specific location text input (e.g., "Near kilometer marker 3")
  - **Description**: Detailed description textarea
  - **Incident Date**: Date picker (cannot be future date)
  - **Incident Time**: Optional time picker
- **Auto-populated**: Trail ID (hidden field)
- **Note**: Informs hiker that their contact info will be included for follow-up

### 3. **Hiker Safety Incident Controller** ✅
- **File**: `app/Http/Controllers/Hiker/SafetyIncidentController.php`
- **Methods**:
  - `store()`: Create new incident report
    - Validates all fields
    - Associates incident with trail and its organization
    - Records hiker as reporter
    - Sets status to 'reported'
    - Returns JSON success response
  - `index()`: Show hiker's reported incidents (paginated)
  - `show()`: View individual incident details (with security check)

### 4. **Database Migration** ✅
- **File**: `database/migrations/2025_10_05_024611_add_hiker_incident_fields_to_safety_incidents_table.php`
- **New Fields Added**:
  - `organization_id` (foreign key to users table)
  - `incident_type` (string: injury, accident, hazard, wildlife, weather, equipment, other)
  - `location` (string 500 chars)
  - `incident_date` (date)
  - `incident_time` (time)
- **Updated Fields**:
  - `severity`: Changed to lowercase values (low, medium, high, critical)
  - `status`: Changed to lowercase values with 'reported' as default
- **Status**: Migration successfully run ✅

### 5. **Updated SafetyIncident Model** ✅
- **File**: `app/Models/SafetyIncident.php`
- **Updates**:
  - Added new fillable fields
  - Added `organization()` relationship
  - Existing relationships: `trail()`, `reporter()`
  - Helper methods for severity/status badge colors

### 6. **Routes Added** ✅
- **File**: `routes/web.php`
- **Middleware**: `auth:sanctum`, `check.approval`, `user.type:hiker`
- **Routes**:
  - `POST /hiker/incidents` → `hiker.incidents.store` (submit report)
  - `GET /hiker/incidents` → `hiker.incidents.index` (list reports)
  - `GET /hiker/incidents/{incident}` → `hiker.incidents.show` (view report)

### 7. **Hiker Incident List View** ✅
- **File**: `resources/views/hiker/incidents/index.blade.php`
- **Features**:
  - Card-based layout
  - Shows: Trail name, incident type, location, description preview, dates
  - Severity and status badges with color coding
  - Empty state with "Browse Trails" CTA

## 🔒 Security Features

1. **Authentication Required**: All hiker incident routes require authentication
2. **User Type Check**: Middleware ensures only hikers can report incidents
3. **Ownership Verification**: Hikers can only view their own reports
4. **CSRF Protection**: Laravel CSRF tokens on all forms
5. **Input Validation**: Server-side validation on all fields
6. **SQL Injection Prevention**: Using Eloquent ORM and parameter binding

## 📊 Data Flow

```
1. Hiker visits trail page (trails/show.blade.php)
2. Clicks "Report Safety Issue" button
3. Modal opens with incident report form
4. Fills out form and submits
5. AJAX POST request to /hiker/incidents
6. HikerSafetyIncidentController validates data
7. Creates SafetyIncident record with:
   - trail_id (from form)
   - organization_id (from trail's user_id)
   - reported_by (authenticated hiker)
   - incident details
   - status: 'reported'
8. Organization is associated automatically
9. Success message shown
10. Hiker can view report in "My Safety Reports"
```

## 🔔 Future Enhancements (TODO)

### Next Steps:
1. **Update Organization Views**: 
   - Show reporter name in organization incident views
   - Display new fields (incident_type, location, incident_date)
   
2. **Notification System**:
   - Send notification to organization when incident is reported
   - Send urgent notification for critical severity incidents
   - Notify hiker when organization responds

3. **Emergency Readiness Feedback**:
   - Create notification system (48 hours after hike completion)
   - Build feedback form for hikers
   - Allow hikers to rate emergency preparedness after hike

## 🎯 Key Differences from Organization System

| Feature | Organization System | Hiker System |
|---------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Access** | Organizations manage their own incidents | Hikers report what they encounter |
| **Purpose** | Internal tracking & management | Community safety reporting |
| **Data Entry** | Comprehensive incident management | Quick, simple reporting |
| **Fields** | More detailed (resolution notes, affected parties) | Essential fields only |
| **Status Flow** | Open → In Progress → Resolved → Closed | Reported → (Org manages) |
| **View Access** | Organization sees all their incidents | Hiker sees only their reports |
| **Location** | Organization dashboard | Trail detail pages |

## ✅ Status: Phase 1 Complete

The hiker-side incident reporting system is now fully functional! Hikers can:
- ✅ Report safety incidents on any trail
- ✅ View their reported incidents
- ✅ Track status and organization responses
- ✅ Access through navigation menu

**Next Phase**: Update organization views to display hiker-reported incidents with new fields.
