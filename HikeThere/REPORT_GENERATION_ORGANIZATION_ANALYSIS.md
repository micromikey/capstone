## ❌ Reports NOT Suitable for Organizations

### 1. **Login Trends Report** ❌

**Fields (for reference only):**
- ❌ `user_name`, `email`, `login_count`, `last_login`, `engagement_level`, `days_since_last_login`

**Alternative:** Aggregate statistics only (e.g., "X% of customers are repeat bookers")

---

### 3. **Community Posts Report** ❌
**Why exclude:** User-generated content and personal activity tracking - privacy concern.

**Fields (for reference only):**
- ❌ `user_name`, `post_id`, `content_preview`, `likes_count`, `comments_count`

**Note:** Organizations might only see posts specifically tagged to their trails (with user anonymization)

**Fields (for reference only):**
- ❌ `user_name`, `account_status`, `warning_count`, `flagged_content`, `moderator_actions`

---

### 5. **Content Trends Report** ❌
**Why exclude:** Analyzes user content behavior and trends - platform analytics, not organization operations.

---

## 📊 Recommended Filter Options for Organizations

When organizations generate reports, they should be able to filter by:

### ✅ Allowed Filters:
- **Date Range** (`date_from`, `date_to`) - Essential for all reports
- **Trail Selection** (`trail_id`) - Only trails they manage
- **Region** (`region_id`) - If they manage multiple regions
- **Booking Status** (`status`) - For booking reports
- **Severity Level** (`severity`) - For safety incident reports
- **Rating Level** (`rating`) - For feedback reports

### ❌ Restricted Filters:
- **User Type** - Should NOT filter by individual user types (privacy)
- **Specific User ID** - Should NOT access individual user data
- **User Email** - Should NOT filter by personal information

---

## 🔐 Privacy & Data Protection Rules

### Rules for Organization Reports:

1. **No Personal Identifiable Information (PII)**
   - No names, emails, phone numbers, addresses
   - User IDs should be excluded or anonymized (e.g., "User #12345")

2. **Aggregated Data Only**
   - Show totals, averages, counts
   - No individual booking/user details

3. **Trail-Scoped Access**
   - Organizations should only see data for trails they manage
   - No access to other organization's data

4. **Anonymous Feedback**
   - Customer feedback should be anonymous
   - No way to trace feedback back to individuals

5. **Safety Exception**
   - Safety incidents MAY include anonymous reference IDs for follow-up
   - But still no personal names/contacts

---

## 🎯 Implementation Recommendations

### Modify ReportService.php:

```php
// Add organization scope to queries
protected function scopeToOrganization($query, $organizationId)
{
    // Only show trails managed by this organization
    $trailIds = Trail::where('organization_id', $organizationId)->pluck('id');
    return $query->whereIn('trail_id', $trailIds);
}

// Remove PII from results
protected function sanitizeForOrganization($data)
{
    unset($data['user_name']);
    unset($data['email']);
    unset($data['user_id']); // or anonymize: $data['user_id'] = 'User_' . $data['user_id'];
    return $data;
}
```

### Modify ReportController.php:

```php
public function generate(Request $request)
{
    // Check if user is organization
    if (auth()->user()->user_type === 'organization') {
        // Validate report type is allowed for organizations
        $allowedReports = [
            'booking_volumes',
            'trail_popularity',
            'emergency_readiness',
            'safety_incidents',
            'feedback_summary'
        ];
        
        if (!in_array($request->report_type, $allowedReports)) {
            return response()->json([
                'error' => 'This report type is not available for organizations'
            ], 403);
        }
        
        // Add organization scope
        $filters['organization_id'] = auth()->user()->organization_id;
    }
    
    // ... rest of generation logic
}
```

### Update index.blade.php:

For organization users, only show the 5 allowed report categories:
- Booking & Operations (with booking_volumes, emergency_readiness)
- Feedback & Safety (with feedback_summary, safety_incidents)
- Trail Analytics (with trail_popularity)

Hide the other report cards for organization users.
