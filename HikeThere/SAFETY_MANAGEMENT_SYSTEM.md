# Emergency Readiness & Safety Incidents Management

## Overview
Complete safety management system for trail organizations to track emergency preparedness and document safety incidents.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Emergency Readiness Assessments
Organizations can assess and track their trail safety preparedness across three key areas:

**Assessment Categories:**
- **Equipment Status** (0-100): First aid kits, emergency supplies, rescue equipment
- **Staff Availability** (0-100): Trained staff, guides, emergency responders
- **Communication Status** (0-100): Radios, phones, emergency communication systems

**Overall Readiness Levels:**
- Excellent (85-100)
- Good (70-84)
- Fair (50-69)
- Needs Improvement (0-49)

### 2. Safety Incidents Tracking
Organizations can log and manage safety incidents that occur on their trails.

**Severity Levels:**
- Critical: Life threatening
- High: Serious injury
- Medium: Minor injury
- Low: Near miss

**Status Tracking:**
- Open: Just reported
- In Progress: Being addressed
- Resolved: Issue fixed
- Closed: Completed

## Files Created

```

### Navigation
- Added "Emergency Readiness" link to organization navbar (desktop & mobile)
- Added "Safety Incidents" link to organization navbar (desktop & mobile)

## Database Tables
These tables were already created by previous migrations:

### emergency_readiness
- trail_id
- equipment_status (0-100)
- staff_availability (0-100)
- communication_status (0-100)
- equipment_notes
- staff_notes
- communication_notes
- recommendations
- assessed_by (user_id)
- timestamps

### safety_incidents
- trail_id
- reported_by (user_id)
- description
- severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- status (Open/In Progress/Resolved/Closed)
- occurred_at
- resolved_at
- resolution_notes
- affected_parties (JSON - anonymized count)
- timestamps

## Usage

### For Organizations

**Emergency Readiness:**
1. Navigate to "Emergency Readiness" in navbar
2. View dashboard with statistics (total assessments, avg score, excellent count, needs improvement)
3. Click "New Assessment" to create assessment
4. Use sliders to rate equipment, staff, and communication (0-100)
5. Add notes for each category and recommendations
6. Submit to track readiness over time

**Safety Incidents:**
1. Navigate to "Safety Incidents" in navbar
2. View dashboard with stats (total, open, critical, resolved this month)
3. Click "Report Incident" to log new incident
4. Select trail, severity level, and date/time
5. Provide detailed description of what happened
6. Enter number of affected parties (anonymized)
7. Set status and add resolution notes
8. Submit to document incident

### Reports Integration
The report system already supports these data sources:
- **Emergency Readiness Report** - View readiness trends and scores
- **Safety Incidents Report** - Analyze incident patterns and resolutions

## Security Features
- Organization-scoped: Organizations only see/manage their own trail data
- User verification: Trail ownership verified before create/update/delete
- PII Protection: Reported_by field anonymized in reports
- Access Control: Requires authentication + organization approval + organization user type

## Key Features
✅ Beautiful, intuitive UI with statistics dashboards  
✅ Real-time scoring and status badges  
✅ Complete CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)  
✅ Organization-scoped data access  
✅ Mobile-responsive design  
✅ Integration with existing trail and report systems  
✅ Proper form validation  
✅ Success/error feedback messages  

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
- [ ] Email notifications for critical incidents
- [ ] Export assessments and incidents to PDF/Excel
- [ ] Photo upload for incident documentation
- [ ] Automated readiness score alerts when below threshold
- [ ] Incident timeline view
- [ ] Multi-trail batch assessments

## Testing
To test the system:
1. Log in as an organization user (approved)
2. Navigate to "Emergency Readiness" or "Safety Incidents"
3. Create sample assessments/incidents for your trails
4. Generate reports to see the data visualization
5. Edit and update records as needed
