# Organization Profile Link Implementation

## Change Summary
Made the organization section in the trail show page clickable to redirect to the organization's profile page.

## What Changed

### Before
The organization name and avatar were displayed as static text without any link.

```html
<div class="flex items-center gap-3">
    <img src="..." alt="..." class="w-12 h-12 rounded-full object-cover">
    <div>
        <p class="font-medium text-gray-900">{{ $trail->user->display_name }}</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Trail Organizer</p>
        ...
    </div>
</div>
```

### After
The organization info is now wrapped in a clickable link that redirects to their profile.

```html
<a href="{{ route('community.organization.show', $trail->user_id) }}" 
   class="flex items-center gap-3 hover:opacity-80 transition-opacity flex-1">
    <img src="..." alt="..." class="w-12 h-12 rounded-full object-cover">
    <div>
        <p class="font-medium text-gray-900 hover:text-green-600 transition-colors">
            {{ $trail->user->display_name }}
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Trail Organizer</p>
        ...
    </div>
</a>
```

## Features Added

1. **Clickable Organization Section**
   - The entire organization card (avatar + name + verification badge) is now clickable
   - Links to: `/community/organization/{organization_id}`

2. **Visual Feedback**
   - Hover effect: Slight opacity reduction on the entire section
   - Organization name changes to green color on hover
   - Smooth transitions for better UX

3. **Preserved Layout**
   - The "Follow" button remains in its position and functions independently
   - Layout structure is maintained with `flex-1` to ensure proper spacing

## Route Used

```php
Route::get('/community/organization/{organization}', [CommunityController::class, 'showOrganization'])
    ->name('community.organization.show');
```
