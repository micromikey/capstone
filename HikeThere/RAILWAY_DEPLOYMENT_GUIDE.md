1. Click "+ New" ‚Üí "Empty Service"
2. Name it "ml-recommender"
3. Connect to the same GitHub repo
4. Set "Root Directory" to `ml-prototype`
5. Railway will detect the Dockerfile and deploy it

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Go to your Laravel service ‚Üí Variables tab and add these:

### Application Settings
```env
APP_NAME=HikeThere
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
APP_KEY=base64:YOUR_GENERATED_KEY_HERE
APP_URL=https://${{RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN}}
APP_TIMEZONE=Asia/Manila
```

**Generate APP_KEY locally:**
```bash
php artisan key:generate --show
```

### Database (Use Railway's variables)
```env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=${{MYSQL_HOST}}
DB_PORT=${{MYSQL_PORT}}
DB_DATABASE=${{MYSQL_DATABASE}}
DB_USERNAME=${{MYSQL_USER}}
DB_PASSWORD=${{MYSQL_PASSWORD}}
```

### Filesystem (Google Cloud Storage)
```env
FILESYSTEM_DISK=gcs
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET=hikethere-production
GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE_PATH_PREFIX=
GOOGLE_CLOUD_KEY_FILE=/app/storage/gcs-credentials.json
```

**For the GCS key file, you have two options:**

**Option A: Use base64 encoded credentials (Recommended)**
```env
GOOGLE_CLOUD_KEY_FILE_CONTENTS=<paste your entire JSON key here>
```

Then create an artisan command or modify your deployment script to write this to a file.

**Option B: Use Railway's File Storage**
Upload the JSON file as a Railway secret file.

### External API Keys
```env
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_production_google_maps_key
ORS_API_KEY=your_production_openrouteservice_key
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_production_openweather_key
```

### Payment Gateway (PRODUCTION KEYS)
```env
PAYMONGO_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_live_your_production_public_key
PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_production_secret_key
```

### Mail Configuration (Example: Gmail SMTP)
```env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-gmail-app-password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@hikethere.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME=HikeThere
```

**Note:** For Gmail, generate an App Password from your Google Account settings.

### Session & Cache
```env
SESSION_DRIVER=database
SESSION_LIFETIME=120
CACHE_STORE=database
QUEUE_CONNECTION=database
```

### Logging
```env
LOG_CHANNEL=stack
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

### ML Recommender Service
If deployed separately on Railway:
```env
ML_RECOMMENDER_URL=https://ml-recommender-production.railway.app
```

If using internal Railway networking:
```env
ML_RECOMMENDER_URL=http://ml-recommender.railway.internal:8001
```

## üîß Step 4: Configure Build and Deploy Commands

Railway should auto-detect your Laravel app using `nixpacks.toml`, but you can override:

### Build Command (if needed)
```bash
composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev && npm ci --only=production && npm run build
```

### Start Command (if needed)
```bash
php artisan migrate --force && php artisan storage:link && php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=$PORT
```

---

## üåê Step 5: Set Up Custom Domain (Optional)

1. Go to your service ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Networking
2. Click "Generate Domain" for a Railway subdomain
3. Or click "Custom Domain" to add your own domain
4. Update your `APP_URL` environment variable with the new domain
5. Railway automatically provisions SSL certificates

---

## üîÑ Step 6: Deploy and Verify

### 6.1 Trigger Deployment

Railway will automatically deploy when you push to the `railway-deployment` branch.

### 6.2 Monitor Deployment

1. Go to Deployments tab
2. Watch the build logs
3. Verify successful deployment

### 6.3 Check Application Health

Visit: `https://your-app.railway.app/up`

You should see a 200 OK response.

### 6.4 Verify Database

Railway will run migrations automatically via the start command. Check logs to ensure migrations succeeded.

### 6.5 Test File Uploads

Upload a profile picture or trail image to verify Google Cloud Storage is working.

---

## üìä Step 7: Monitoring and Maintenance

### View Logs
```
Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Your Service ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí View Logs
```

### Database Access

Railway provides a PostgreSQL/MySQL client. Click on your database service to get connection details.

### Metrics

Railway automatically tracks:
- CPU usage
- Memory usage
- Network traffic
- Response times

### Scaling

Railway automatically scales based on load, but you can also:
1. Go to Settings
2. Adjust CPU/RAM limits
3. Enable horizontal scaling (Pro plan)

---

## üîí Security Best Practices

### 1. Environment Variables
‚úÖ Never commit `.env` files  
‚úÖ Use Railway's secret management  
‚úÖ Rotate API keys regularly  

### 2. Database Security
‚úÖ Railway databases are private by default  
‚úÖ Use strong passwords (auto-generated)  
‚úÖ Enable automated backups (in settings)  

### 3. Application Security
‚úÖ Ensure `APP_DEBUG=false` in production  
‚úÖ Security headers middleware is active  
‚úÖ HTTPS is enforced by Railway  

### 4. Google Cloud Storage
‚úÖ Use signed URLs for private files  
‚úÖ Configure bucket permissions carefully  
‚úÖ Enable versioning for backups

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

**Check build logs:**
```
Railway ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí Failed Build ‚Üí View Logs
```

**Common issues:**
- Missing Composer dependencies: Add to `composer.json`
- Node build errors: Check `package.json` scripts
- PHP version mismatch: Verify `nixpacks.toml`

### Application Errors (500)

**Check application logs:**
```
Railway ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí View Logs
```

**Common issues:**
- Missing `APP_KEY`: Generate and set in environment variables
- Database connection: Verify `DB_*` variables
- File permissions: Check storage directories

### Database Connection Issues

**Verify variables:**
```bash
# In Railway shell (click service ‚Üí Connect)
echo $MYSQL_HOST
echo $MYSQL_DATABASE
```

**Test connection:**
```bash
php artisan db:show
```

### File Upload Issues (GCS)

**Check credentials:**
- Verify `GOOGLE_CLOUD_KEY_FILE` path
- Ensure service account has Storage Admin role
- Check bucket name and permissions

**Test locally:**
```bash
# Install GCS package
composer require google/cloud-storage

# Test in tinker
php artisan tinker
Storage::disk('gcs')->put('test.txt', 'Hello World');
```

### ML Service Not Responding

**Check ML service:**
- Verify it's deployed and running
- Check `ML_RECOMMENDER_URL` is correct
- Test endpoint: `curl https://your-ml-service/health`

---

## üîÑ Continuous Deployment

Railway automatically deploys when you push to your connected branch:

```bash
# Make changes locally
git add .
git commit -m "Update feature"
git push origin railway-deployment

# Railway automatically detects push and redeploys
```

### Rollback

If a deployment fails:
1. Go to Deployments
2. Find the last successful deployment
3. Click "Redeploy"

---

## üìà Performance Optimization

### 1. Enable OPcache (Already configured in Dockerfile)

### 2. Configure Route Caching
```bash
# Run in production
php artisan route:cache
php artisan config:cache
php artisan view:cache
```

These are already in the build process via `nixpacks.toml`.

### 3. Use CDN for Assets

Consider using Cloudflare or similar CDN for:
- Static images
- CSS/JS files
- User-uploaded content

### 4. Database Optimization

- Add indexes to frequently queried columns
- Use eager loading to avoid N+1 queries
- Enable query caching
