# ✅ Booking & Payment Integration - COMPLETE!

## 🎉 Integration Successfully Completed

Your **Booking** and **BookingPayment** systems are now fully integrated and working together seamlessly!

---

## 📊 What Was Done

### 1. ✅ Database Changes
- **Migration**: `2025_10_02_130000_add_booking_id_to_booking_payments_table.php`
  - Added `booking_id` foreign key to link payments to bookings
  - Added `user_id` foreign key for quick user reference
  - Added composite index for performance
  - ✅ Successfully migrated

### 2. ✅ Model Updates

**Booking Model** (`app/Models/Booking.php`)
```php
// New relationship
public function payment()
{
    return $this->hasOne(BookingPayment::class);
}

// New helper methods
isPaid()                 // Check if booking is paid
hasPaymentPending()      // Check if payment is pending
getAmountInPesos()       // Get price in pesos (from price_cents)
```

**BookingPayment Model** (`app/Models/BookingPayment.php`)
```php
// New relationships
public function booking()
{
    return $this->belongsTo(Booking::class);
}

public function user()
{
    return $this->belongsTo(User::class);
}

// Added fillable fields: booking_id, user_id
```

### 3. ✅ Controller Updates

**BookingController** (`app/Http/Controllers/Hiker/BookingController.php`)
- After booking creation, redirects to payment instead of booking details
- Passes `booking_id` to payment form for pre-filling

**PaymentController** (`app/Http/Controllers/PaymentController.php`)
- `create()`: Accepts `booking_id`, loads booking, pre-fills form
- `processPayment()`: Links payment to booking via `booking_id`
- `webhook()`: Updates both payment status AND booking status when paid
- `success()`: Shows both payment and booking information

### 4. ✅ View Updates

**Payment Form** (`resources/views/payment/pay.blade.php`)
- Shows booking info banner when `booking_id` present
- Auto-fills all form fields from booking data
- Makes booking-related fields readonly (mountain, date, participants, amount)
- Hidden input passes `booking_id` to payment processing

**Success Page** (`resources/views/payment/success.blade.php`)
- Displays payment ID
- Displays linked booking ID
- Shows payment status badge
- Shows all booking details

## 🧪 How to Test

### Method 1: Using Existing Booking

```bash
# 1. Create a test booking via your booking form
# 2. You'll be automatically redirected to payment
# 3. Form will be pre-filled
# 4. Complete payment with test card: 4120 0000 0000 0007
# 5. Check success page shows both booking and payment info
```

### Method 2: Manual Test via Database

```bash
php artisan tinker
```

```php
// Find or create a booking
$booking = Booking::first();

// Check if it has payment
$booking->payment; // null or BookingPayment object

// Check payment status
$booking->isPaid(); // false
$booking->hasPaymentPending(); // false

// Visit payment page for this booking
// http://localhost:8000/payment/create?booking_id=1
```

### Method 3: Query Tests

```php
// Get all bookings with payments
$bookings = Booking::with('payment')->get();

foreach ($bookings as $booking) {
    echo "Booking #{$booking->id}: ";
    echo $booking->isPaid() ? 'PAID' : 'NOT PAID';
    echo "\n";
}

// Get all payments with bookings
$payments = BookingPayment::with('booking.trail')->get();

foreach ($payments as $payment) {
    echo "Payment #{$payment->id}: ";
    echo $payment->booking ? "Booking #{$payment->booking->id}" : "No booking";
    echo " | Status: {$payment->payment_status}\n";
}
```

## 💡 Usage Examples

### In Blade Views

**Check if booking has payment:**
```blade
@if($booking->payment)
    <p>Payment Status: {{ $booking->payment->payment_status }}</p>
@else
    <a href="{{ route('payment.create', ['booking_id' => $booking->id]) }}">
        Pay Now
    </a>
@endif
```

**Show payment status badge:**
```blade
@if($booking->isPaid())
    <span class="badge badge-success">✓ Paid</span>
@elseif($booking->hasPaymentPending())
    <span class="badge badge-warning">⏳ Pending Payment</span>
@else
    <span class="badge badge-secondary">No Payment</span>
@endif
```

### In Controllers

**Create booking and redirect to payment:**
```php
$booking = Booking::create($data);

return redirect()->route('payment.create', [
    'booking_id' => $booking->id
])->with('success', 'Booking created! Please complete payment.');
```

**Check booking payment status:**
```php
if ($booking->isPaid()) {
    // Booking is paid, allow access
} else {
    // Redirect to payment
    return redirect()->route('payment.create', [
        'booking_id' => $booking->id
    ]);
}
```
