# GCS Storage Fixes Applied ✅

**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Branch:** railway-deployment  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

---

## Changes Summary

All storage operations have been updated to use the configured storage disk (GCS in production) instead of hardcoded local storage.

---

## 🔧 Fix #1: Trail Image Storage

**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/OrganizationTrailController.php`  
**Method:** `handleTrailImages()`  
**Lines Modified:** 608-696

### Changes Made:

✅ **Added disk configuration detection:**
```php
// Get the configured default disk (should be 'gcs' in production)
$disk = config('filesystems.default', 'public');
```

✅ **Removed hardcoded 'public' disk from all image uploads:**

**Before:**
```php
$primaryPath = $primaryFile->storeAs(
    'trail-images/primary',
    $primaryFile->hashName(),
    ['disk' => 'public', 'quality' => 100]  // ❌ Hardcoded
);
```

**After:**
```php
$primaryPath = $primaryFile->storeAs(
    'trail-images/primary',
    $primaryFile->hashName(),
    $disk  // ✅ Uses configured disk (GCS)
);
```

✅ **Applied to all three image types:**
- Primary images (`trail-images/primary/`)
- Additional images (`trail-images/additional/`)
- Map images (`trail-images/maps/`)

✅ **Enhanced logging:**
```php
Log::info('Primary image uploaded', [
    'path' => $primaryPath,
    'disk' => $disk  // Now logs which disk was used
]);
```

### Impact:
- 🎯 Images now upload to GCS in production
- 🎯 No more ephemeral storage on Railway
- 🎯 Images persist across redeployments
- 🎯 Maintains backward compatibility for local development

## 🔧 Fix #2: GPX Library Storage

**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/GPXLibraryController.php`  
**Methods:** `index()`, `parseGPX()`, `searchTrails()`

### Changes Made:

✅ **Added Storage facade import:**
```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Storage;
```

✅ **Updated `index()` method to read from storage:**

**Before:**
```php
$gpxDirectory = public_path('geojson');
if (is_dir($gpxDirectory)) {
    $files = glob($gpxDirectory . '/*.gpx');
    // ... local filesystem operations
}
```

**After:**
```php
$disk = config('filesystems.default', 'public');
$files = Storage::disk($disk)->files('geojson');
$gpxFilesList = array_filter($files, function($file) {
    return pathinfo($file, PATHINFO_EXTENSION) === 'gpx';
});
```

✅ **Updated file operations to use Storage facade:**
```php
// Get file metadata
$size = Storage::disk($disk)->size($filePath);
$modified = Storage::disk($disk)->lastModified($filePath);
$url = Storage::disk($disk)->url($filePath);
```

✅ **Updated `parseGPX()` method:**

**Before:**
```php
$filePath = public_path('geojson/' . $filename);
if (!file_exists($filePath)) { ... }
$gpxContent = file_get_contents($filePath);
```

**After:**
```php
$disk = config('filesystems.default', 'public');
$filePath = 'geojson/' . $filename;
if (!Storage::disk($disk)->exists($filePath)) { ... }
$gpxContent = Storage::disk($disk)->get($filePath);
```

✅ **Updated `searchTrails()` method:**

**Before:**
```php
$gpxDirectory = public_path('geojson');
if (is_dir($gpxDirectory)) {
    $files = glob($gpxDirectory . '/*.gpx');
    foreach ($files as $file) {
        $gpxContent = file_get_contents($file);
        // ...
    }
}
```

**After:**
```php
$disk = config('filesystems.default', 'public');
$files = Storage::disk($disk)->files('geojson');
$gpxFilesList = array_filter($files, function($file) {
    return pathinfo($file, PATHINFO_EXTENSION) === 'gpx';
});
foreach ($gpxFilesList as $filePath) {
    $gpxContent = Storage::disk($disk)->get($filePath);
    // ...
}
```

### Impact:
- 🎯 GPX library now reads from GCS in production
- 🎯 Trail auto-routing works with GCS-stored files
- 🎯 Manual GPX selection works with GCS-stored files
- 🎯 Maintains local development compatibility

## ✅ What's Already Correct

### Google Places Images
**File:** `app/Services/TrailImageService.php`  
**Status:** ✅ No changes needed

- Images are fetched as direct URLs from Google Maps API
- No storage required (served from Google's CDN)
- Correctly implemented with API authentication

### GPX File Uploads
**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/OrganizationTrailController.php`  
**Method:** `storeGPXFile()`  
**Status:** ✅ Already correct

- Already respects `FILESYSTEM_DISK` configuration
- Has proper fallback logic if GCS is misconfigured
- No changes needed

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to Railway, ensure:

### Railway Environment Variables
- [ ] `FILESYSTEM_DISK=gcs`
- [ ] `GCS_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id`
- [ ] `GCS_BUCKET=your-bucket-name`
- [ ] `GCS_KEY_FILE_CONTENT=base64_encoded_service_account_key`

### GCS Bucket Structure
Ensure these folders exist in your GCS bucket:
- [ ] `trail-images/primary/`
- [ ] `trail-images/additional/`
- [ ] `trail-images/maps/`
- [ ] `trail-gpx/`
- [ ] `geojson/` (with your GPX files)

### GCS Bucket Permissions
- [ ] Bucket is set to public read OR
- [ ] Signed URLs are configured (if private bucket)

### Testing After Deployment
1. [ ] Create a new trail
2. [ ] Upload a primary image
3. [ ] Check Railway logs for: `"Primary image uploaded"` with `"disk":"gcs"`
4. [ ] Verify image appears in GCS bucket
5. [ ] Verify image displays on trail page
6. [ ] Open "Browse GPX Library" in trail creation
7. [ ] Verify GPX files are listed from GCS
8. [ ] Test auto-route feature with GPX library

## 📋 File Changes Summary

| File | Status | Changes |
|------|--------|---------|
| `OrganizationTrailController.php` | ✅ Modified | Trail images now use configured disk |
| `GPXLibraryController.php` | ✅ Modified | GPX library reads from configured disk |
| `TrailImageService.php` | ✅ No change | Already correct (Google Places URLs) |
| `config/filesystems.php` | ✅ No change | GCS config already correct |

## 🔄 Rollback Instructions

If issues occur, you can rollback by:

1. Set `FILESYSTEM_DISK=public` in Railway environment
2. Redeploy the application
3. This will revert to local storage (ephemeral on Railway)

**Note:** Only do this as a temporary measure. Long-term solution requires GCS.

---

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### Local Development (FILESYSTEM_DISK=public)
- Images stored in `storage/app/public/trail-images/`
- GPX files stored in `storage/app/public/geojson/`
- Accessible via `php artisan storage:link`

### Production on Railway (FILESYSTEM_DISK=gcs)
- Images stored in GCS bucket at `trail-images/*`
- GPX files read from GCS bucket at `geojson/*`
- Accessible via public GCS URLs
- Persistent across redeployments

---

## 🎉 Benefits

✅ **Data Persistence** - Files survive Railway redeployments  
✅ **Scalability** - GCS handles unlimited storage  
✅ **Performance** - GCS CDN for fast image delivery  
✅ **Reliability** - Google's infrastructure  
✅ **Cost-Effective** - Pay only for what you use  
✅ **Development/Production Parity** - Same code, different config  

---

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check Railway logs for error messages
2. Verify GCS environment variables are set
3. Test GCS bucket permissions
4. Check `GCS_STORAGE_AUDIT.md` for detailed troubleshooting
