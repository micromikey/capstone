## üî• CRITICAL: You Must Complete These Steps

### Step 1: Add Railway Environment Variables

Go to Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Variables tab and add these 4 variables:

```
FILESYSTEM_DISK=gcs
GCS_PROJECT_ID=hikethere
GCS_BUCKET=hikethere-storage
GCS_KEY_FILE_CONTENT=<paste the base64 string below>
```

**Where to get the base64 key:**
1. Open: `C:\Users\Michael Torres\Downloads\gcs-key-base64.txt`
2. Copy ALL 3,148 characters (it's one long line)
3. Paste into Railway's `GCS_KEY_FILE_CONTENT` variable

**Note:** The key should look like: `ewogICJ0eXBlIjogInNlcnZpY2VfYWNjb3VudCIsC...` (very long string)

---

### Step 2: Make GCS Bucket Public

You need to allow public read access so profile pictures are visible to everyone.

**Option A - Command Line (Fastest):**
```bash
gsutil iam ch allUsers:objectViewer gs://hikethere-storage
```

**Option B - Console (Visual):**
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/hikethere-storage
2. Click "Permissions" tab
3. Click "Grant Access"
4. New Principal: `allUsers`
5. Role: "Storage Object Viewer"
6. Click "Save"

---

### Step 3: Wait for Railway Deployment

After adding the environment variables, Railway will automatically redeploy. This takes about **2-3 minutes**.

**Check deployment status:**
- Go to Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Deployments
- Wait for green checkmark ‚úÖ
- Click "View Logs" to see deployment progress

---

### Step 4: Test Profile Picture Upload

Once Railway shows deployment complete:

1. Go to: https://hikethere-production.up.railway.app/profile
2. Click "Change Profile Picture" or edit profile
3. Upload a new image (JPG/PNG, max 2MB)
4. **Verify the URL** - Open browser DevTools (F12):
   - Network tab ‚Üí Look for the uploaded image
   - URL should be: `https://storage.googleapis.com/hikethere-storage/profile-pictures/...`
   - ‚ùå Should NOT be: `hikethere-production.up.railway.app/storage/...`

---

### Step 5: Test Persistence (CRITICAL)

This is the whole point - make sure files don't disappear!

1. Upload a profile picture
2. **Note the filename** (e.g., `profile-pictures/abc123.jpg`)
3. Trigger Railway restart:
   - Go to Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Deployments
   - Click "Redeploy" on latest deployment
4. Wait for restart (~2-3 minutes)
5. Refresh your profile page
6. ‚úÖ Profile picture should **still be there**
7. Verify in GCS Console:
   - https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/hikethere-storage/profile-pictures
   - Your image should be listed

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Error: "Driver [gcs] is not supported"

**Cause:** Environment variables not added to Railway yet  
**Fix:** Complete Step 1 above  
**Note:** Your app won't crash - it will fall back to local storage

### Error: "403 Forbidden" when viewing images

**Cause:** Bucket not made public  
**Fix:** Complete Step 2 above

### Images upload but disappear after restart

**Cause:** Railway is still using local storage instead of GCS  
**Fix:** 
1. Check Railway logs for: `GCS configured but bucket not set, using public disk`
2. Verify `FILESYSTEM_DISK=gcs` is set in Railway
3. Verify `GCS_KEY_FILE_CONTENT` is not empty
4. Check for typos in variable names

### How to check what storage is being used

**Check Railway logs:**
```bash
# Should see this when GCS is working:
[INFO] Storing profile picture to GCS: profile-pictures/abc123.jpg

# Should NOT see these warnings:
[WARNING] GCS configured but bucket not set, using public disk
[ERROR] GCS configuration error: ...
```

**Check profile picture URL:**
- GCS (correct): `https://storage.googleapis.com/hikethere-storage/profile-pictures/abc123.jpg`
- Local (wrong): `https://hikethere-production.up.railway.app/storage/profile-pictures/abc123.jpg`

---

## üìä What Changed in Your Code

### Safety Checks Added

All storage operations now have graceful fallback logic:

```php
$disk = config('filesystems.default', 'public');
if ($disk === 'gcs') {
    try {
        if (!config('filesystems.disks.gcs.bucket')) {
            $disk = 'public'; // Fall back if not configured
            \Log::warning('GCS configured but bucket not set, using public disk');
        }
    } catch (\Exception $e) {
        $disk = 'public'; // Fall back on any error
        \Log::error('GCS configuration error: ' . $e->getMessage());
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- App won't crash if GCS misconfigured
- Automatically falls back to local storage
- Logs warnings for debugging
- Allows smooth transition from local ‚Üí GCS

### Files Modified

1. **app/Models/User.php** (lines 349-371)
   - `getProfilePictureUrlAttribute()` now supports GCS URLs
   - Returns GCS URL when configured, local URL as fallback

2. **app/Http/Controllers/ProfileController.php**
   - `updateHikerProfile()` - Picture-only upload (lines 68-94)
   - `updateHikerProfile()` - Full profile update (lines 130-154)
   - `updateOrganizationProfile()` - Picture-only (lines 169-207)
   - `updateOrganizationProfile()` - Full update (lines 239-261)
   - `deleteProfilePicture()` - Delete handler (lines 276-294)
   - `uploadProfilePicture()` - AJAX endpoint (lines 303-343)

All 6 methods now use dynamic storage with safety checks!

## üéØ Success Criteria

You'll know GCS is working correctly when:

‚úÖ Profile pictures upload successfully  
‚úÖ Image URLs are `storage.googleapis.com` (not Railway)  
‚úÖ Images persist after Railway restart  
‚úÖ Delete functionality removes files from GCS  
‚úÖ Default avatars show when no picture uploaded  
‚úÖ No errors in Railway logs about GCS  

---

## üìù Next Steps After GCS Works

Once GCS is confirmed working:

1. **Test all upload scenarios:**
   - ‚úÖ **Profile Pictures:**
     - Hiker profile picture upload
     - Organization profile picture upload
     - Picture update (replacing existing)
     - Picture delete
     - AJAX upload via "Change Picture" button
   
   - ‚úÖ **Trail Reviews:**
     - Upload review images (up to 5 photos per review)
     - View review images in trail details
     - Delete reviews with images
   
   - ‚úÖ **Support Tickets:**
     - Create ticket with attachments (images, PDFs, documents)
     - Reply to ticket with attachments
     - Delete ticket (should delete all attachments)
     - View/download attachments
   
   - ‚úÖ **Organization Payment QR Codes:**
     - Upload manual payment QR code
     - Replace existing QR code
     - View QR code on booking page
   
   - ‚úÖ **Organization Registration:**
     - Business permit upload
     - Government ID upload
     - Additional documents upload
     - View documents in admin approval panel

2. **Monitor GCS usage:**
   - https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/hikethere-storage
   - Check file count and storage size
   - Verify folder structure:
     - `profile-pictures/` - User and organization avatars
     - `review-images/` - Trail review photos
     - `support-attachments/` - Help desk files
     - `qr_codes/` - Payment QR codes
     - `organization_documents/` - Registration files
     - `trail-images/` - Trail photos (if any)
   - Monitor for unexpected file growth

3. **Consider migration:**
   - If you have existing files in Railway local storage
   - They won't be accessible after restart
   - Users will need to re-upload OR
   - You can migrate them manually to GCS (see migration script in docs)
