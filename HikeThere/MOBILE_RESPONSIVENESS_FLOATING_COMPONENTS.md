# Mobile Responsiveness - Floating Components

## Overview
Hidden floating navigation and floating weather components on mobile and tablet devices for a cleaner, more mobile-friendly interface.

## Changes Made

### 1. Floating Navigation Component
**File**: `resources/views/components/floating-navigation.blade.php`

**Before:**
- Scaled down on tablets (0.9x scale)
- Adjusted positioning on smaller screens
- Still visible on mobile, causing clutter

**After:**
```css
@media (max-width: 1024px) {
    #floating-navigation {
        display: none !important;
    }
}
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Hidden on tablets and mobile devices (≤1024px width)
- ✅ Only visible on desktop/laptop screens
- ✅ Reduces screen clutter on smaller devices
- ✅ Main navigation in header remains accessible

---

### 2. Floating Weather Component
**File**: `resources/views\components\floating-weather.blade.php`

**Before:**
- Scaled down and repositioned on smaller screens
- Visible but cramped on mobile devices
- Complex responsive adjustments (multiple breakpoints)

**After:**
```css
@media (max-width: 1024px) {
    #floating-weather,
    #floating-weather-minimized {
        display: none !important;
    }
}
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Hidden on tablets and mobile devices (≤1024px width)
- ✅ Only visible on desktop/laptop screens
- ✅ Weather section in main dashboard still available
- ✅ Cleaner mobile interface

## Breakpoint Strategy

### Desktop/Laptop (> 1024px)
- ✅ Floating navigation visible (left side)
- ✅ Floating weather visible (right side)
- ✅ Full desktop experience

### Tablet/Mobile (≤ 1024px)
- ❌ Floating navigation hidden
- ❌ Floating weather hidden
- ✅ Main dashboard weather section available
- ✅ Standard page navigation via scrolling
- ✅ Cleaner, less cluttered interface

## Why 1024px Breakpoint?

**1024px** is the standard tablet breakpoint and covers:
- iPad (768px - 1024px portrait/landscape)
- Smaller tablets
- All mobile phones (320px - 480px)
- Medium tablets (600px - 768px)

This ensures:
- Floating components only appear on proper desktop screens
- Tablets get mobile-optimized layout
- No overlap or clutter on smaller screens
