# Payment After Booking - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Changed the booking flow so that payment information is collected **AFTER** the booking is created, not during the booking creation process.

## New Flow

### Before (Old Flow):
1. Hiker fills booking details
2. **Payment section appears on same page**
3. Hiker uploads payment proof/sees gateway info
4. Submit booking + payment together
5. Done

### After (New Flow):
1. Hiker fills booking details (trail, date, party size, notes)
2. Submit booking (NO payment info yet)
3. **Redirect to dedicated payment page**
4. Choose payment method and complete payment
5. Done

    'date' => $date,
    'party_size' => $partySize,
    'notes' => $notes,
    'status' => 'pending',
    'payment_status' => 'unpaid',  // NEW
    'payment_method_used' => null,  // NEW
    'price_cents' => $calculatedPrice,
]
```

### After Payment Submission (Manual):
```php
[
    // ... existing fields ...
    'payment_status' => 'pending',  // Awaiting verification
    'payment_method_used' => 'manual',
    'payment_proof_path' => 'storage/payment_proofs/...',
    'transaction_number' => '123456789',
    'payment_notes' => 'Paid via GCash',
]
```

### After Payment Submission (Automatic):
```php
[
    // ... existing fields ...
    'payment_method_used' => 'automatic',
    // Then redirects to gateway
]
```

## Success Messages

### After Booking Creation:
```
"Booking created! Please complete your payment to confirm your reservation."
```

### After Manual Payment Submission:
```
"Payment proof submitted! The organization will verify your payment and confirm your booking."
```

### After Automatic Payment Redirect:

```

## Error Handling

- Invalid payment proof → Show error, keep form data
- File too large → Alert user
- Missing transaction number → Validation error
- Unauthorized access → 403 Forbidden

## Quick Start for Developers

### To add payment after booking:
```php
// 1. Create booking
$booking = Booking::create([...]);

// 2. Redirect to payment
return redirect()->route('booking.payment', $booking);

// 3. User sees payment page
// 4. User submits payment
// 5. Process payment in submitPayment() method
```

### To check if booking needs payment:
```php
if ($booking->payment_status === 'unpaid') {
    // Show "Pay Now" button
}
```

### To display payment page:
```php
Route::get('/booking/{booking}/payment', [BookingController::class, 'showPayment'])
    ->name('booking.payment');
```

---

**Result**: Clean separation between booking creation and payment processing, improved user experience, and more flexible payment workflow!
