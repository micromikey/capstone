    <x-nav-link :href="route('reports.index')" :active="request()->routeIs('reports.*')">
        {{ __('Reports') }}
    </x-nav-link>
@endif
```

### Option 2: Add to Dashboard
Edit: `resources/views/dashboard.blade.php` (or org dashboard)

    <svg class="w-5 h-5 mr-2" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24">

## üìä Sample Data (For Testing)

If you don't have data yet, you can create sample data:

### Create Emergency Readiness Entry:
```bash
php artisan tinker
```

```php
\App\Models\Trail::first()->emergencyReadiness()->create([
    'equipment_status' => 85,
    'staff_availability' => 90,
    'communication_status' => 75,
    'equipment_notes' => 'All equipment checked and functional',
    'assessed_by' => auth()->id()
]);
```

### Create Safety Incident:
```php
\App\Models\Trail::first()->safetyIncidents()->create([
    'description' => 'Minor slip on wet rocks',
    'severity' => 'Low',
    'status' => 'Resolved',
    'occurred_at' => now()->subDays(5),
    'resolved_at' => now()->subDays(3)
]);
```

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Reports page not found (404)"
**Solution:** Make sure you're logged in as an organization user and approved.

### Issue: "No trails in dropdown"
**Solution:** Your organization needs to have created trails first.

### Issue: "Table doesn't exist" error
**Solution:** Run migrations: `php artisan migrate`

### Issue: "No data in reports"
**Solution:** 
- Check date range - try expanding to last 90 days
- Add sample data (see above)
- Verify bookings exist for your trails

### Issue: "Permission denied (403)"
**Solution:** 
- Ensure you're logged in as organization
- Ensure organization is approved
- Check that trail ownership is correct
