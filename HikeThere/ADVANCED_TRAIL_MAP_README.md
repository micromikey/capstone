## Usage

### Basic Usage
1. Navigate to `/advanced-trail-map` for the main map interface
2. Use the search bar to find specific trails
3. Click on trail markers or use the trail search for detailed information
4. Get directions to trails with enhanced error handling and route alternatives
5. View Street View at trail locations for visual exploration
6. Toggle various overlays (weather, elevation, facilities) as needed

### With Specific Trail
1. Navigate to `/advanced-trail-map/{trail-slug}` to load a specific trail
2. The trail will be automatically selected and centered on the map
3. All trail details will be pre-loaded in the interface

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/trails/map-data` - Retrieve all trails for map display
- `GET /api/trails/{trail}/details` - Get comprehensive trail information
- `POST /api/weather/trail-conditions` - Get weather data for trail location
