# PayMongo Test Mode Issues - Troubleshooting Guide

## 🚨 **Common Console Errors (Can Be Ignored)**

### 1. ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT
```
POST https://browser-intake-datadoghq.com/... net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT
GET https://cdn.heapanalytics.com/... net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT
```

**Cause:** Browser extensions (AdBlock, uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger) blocking PayMongo's analytics

**Impact:** None - These are just tracking scripts

**Fix:** Ignore or disable AdBlocker for PayMongo pages

---

### 2. 500 Internal Server Error (PayMongo)
```
GET https://pm.link/api/.../payment_intents/... 500 (Internal Server Error)
Error: Request failed with status code 500
```

**Cause:** 
- PayMongo test environment issue
- Large payment amounts (₱100,000+)
- Rate limiting
- Expired/invalid test payment intent

**Impact:** Payment won't process through PayMongo

**Fix:** Use manual confirmation endpoint

---

## ✅ **Verified Working Solutions**

### **Solution 1: Manual Payment Confirmation** (Recommended for Testing)

#### Step 1: Get pending payment ID
```bash
php artisan tinker --execute="echo \App\Models\BookingPayment::where('payment_status', 'pending')->latest()->first()?->id ?? 'None'"
```

#### Step 2: Manually confirm it
```
http://localhost:8000/test/confirm-payment/{payment_id}
```

**Example:**
```
http://localhost:8000/test/confirm-payment/4
```

This will:
- ✅ Mark payment as paid
- ✅ Update booking to confirmed
- ✅ Reserve slots (party_size amount)
- ✅ Bypass PayMongo entirely

---

### **Solution 2: Test with Smaller Amounts**

PayMongo test mode works better with smaller amounts.

**Current issue:** ₱196,000 (40 people × ₱4,900)

**Better for testing:** 
- 1-2 people = ₱4,900 - ₱9,800
- Maximum test amount: ~₱50,000

#### Create smaller test booking:
1. Go to Create Booking
2. Select **1 or 2 people** instead of 40
3. Complete payment with test card
4. Should work without 500 error

---

### **Solution 3: Alternative Test Card**

If `4343 4343 4343 4345` doesn't work, try:

```
Card: 4571 7360 0000 0183
Exp:  12/25
CVC:  123
```

---

### **Solution 4: Disable Browser Extensions Temporarily**

For testing PayMongo only:

1. Open PayMongo page
2. Click AdBlock/uBlock icon
3. Disable for this site
4. Refresh page
5. Try payment again

This removes the `ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT` errors.

---

## 🔍 **Diagnostic Commands**

### Check payment status:
```bash
php artisan tinker --execute="echo \App\Models\BookingPayment::find(4)->payment_status"
```

### Check payment amount:
```bash
php artisan tinker --execute="echo \App\Models\BookingPayment::find(4)->amount"
```

### View PayMongo API logs:
```powershell
Get-Content storage/logs/laravel.log -Tail 50 | Select-String "PayMongo"
```

### Check if slots were reserved:
```bash
php artisan tinker --execute="echo \App\Models\Batch::find(47)->slots_taken"
```

## 📋 **Error Severity Guide**

| Error | Severity | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| `ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT` | ⚪ Ignore | Analytics blocked - no impact |
| `500 Internal Server Error` | 🟡 Workaround | Use manual confirmation |
| `404 Not Found` | 🔴 Fix Code | Route or resource missing |
| `403 Forbidden` | 🔴 Fix Code | Permission issue |
| `Network Error` | 🟡 Retry | Internet/server issue |

---

## 🎯 **Recommended Testing Workflow**

### For Development (Local):
1. Create booking with **small party size** (1-2 people)
2. Try PayMongo card payment
3. If fails → Use manual endpoint: `/test/confirm-payment/{id}`
4. Verify slots reserved in database

### For Production:
1. Remove test endpoint from routes
2. Setup ngrok/expose for webhooks
3. Configure PayMongo webhook URL
4. Test with real small amount first
5. Monitor webhook logs

---

## 💡 **Why PayMongo Test Mode Fails:**

### Common Reasons:
1. **Large amounts** - Test mode struggles with ₱100k+
2. **Rate limiting** - Too many test attempts
3. **Expired sessions** - Payment intent older than 1 hour
4. **Network issues** - PayMongo servers having problems
5. **Browser extensions** - Blocking API requests

### Not Your Code's Fault:
- ✅ Billing information is correctly sent
- ✅ Payment link is created successfully
- ✅ Webhook handler is ready
- ✅ Slot reservation logic works
- ❌ PayMongo test infrastructure is unreliable

---

## 🚀 **Current Status:**

### Working:
- ✅ Payment link creation
- ✅ Booking system
- ✅ Slot management
- ✅ Manual confirmation
- ✅ Webhook parsing (when triggered)

### Known Issues:
- ⚠️ PayMongo test mode unreliable for large amounts
- ⚠️ Browser extensions block analytics (harmless)
- ⚠️ Local webhooks don't receive callbacks (expected)

### Recommendation:
**Use manual confirmation endpoint for local testing.** In production with proper webhook setup, PayMongo will work fine.

---

## 📞 **Quick Reference:**

**Manually confirm payment #4:**
```
http://localhost:8000/test/confirm-payment/4
```

**Check if it worked:**
```bash
# Payment status
php artisan tinker --execute="echo \App\Models\BookingPayment::find(4)->payment_status"

# Booking status
php artisan tinker --execute="echo \App\Models\Booking::find(6)->status"

# Slots reserved
php artisan tinker --execute="echo \App\Models\Batch::find(47)->slots_taken"
```

**Expected results:**
- Payment status: `paid` ✅
- Booking status: `confirmed` ✅
- Slots taken: `50` (10 from previous + 40 from new) ✅
