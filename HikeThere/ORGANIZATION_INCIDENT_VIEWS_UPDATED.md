## üìä Data Compatibility

### Handles Both Formats:
The system now seamlessly handles both old and new data formats:

| Field | Old Format | New Format |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| **Severity** | 'Critical', 'High', 'Medium', 'Low' | 'critical', 'high', 'medium', 'low' |
| **Status** | 'Open', 'In Progress', 'Resolved', 'Closed' | 'reported', 'open', 'in progress', 'resolved', 'closed' |

### Statistics Counting:
- **Open Incidents**: Counts 'Open', 'open', AND 'reported' status
- **Critical Incidents**: Counts both 'Critical' and 'critical'
- **Resolved**: Counts both 'Resolved' and 'resolved'

---

## üîç Filtering & Sorting

### Available Filters:
1. **Tab Filters**:
   - All Incidents (default)
   - Hiker Reports (only hiker-reported)
   - Pending Review (reported/open status)

2. **Query Filters** (existing):
   - Status dropdown
   - Severity dropdown
   - Trail selection

### Filter Logic:
- **Hiker Reports**: `reported_by IS NOT NULL AND reported_by != organization_id`
- **Case-Insensitive**: Handles both old and new formats automatically
- **Preserves Pagination**: Filters work with paginated results

---

## üîí Security

- **Organization Scoping**: Only shows incidents for organization's trails
- **Reporter Privacy**: Shows reporter name to organization (for follow-up)
- **Edit/Delete Permissions**: Organization can manage all incidents on their trails
- **Validation**: All filters validated before query execution

---

## üì± Responsive Design

- **Mobile Friendly**: Tabs stack on mobile devices
- **Touch Targets**: Larger touch areas for mobile interaction
- **Readable Badges**: Text remains legible on all screen sizes
- **Flexible Layout**: Cards adapt to container width

---

## üéØ Organization Workflow

### When Hiker Reports Incident:
1. **Incident appears** in organization dashboard
2. **Status**: 'reported' (shows in Pending Review tab)
3. **Reporter visible**: Organization can see who reported it
4. **All details shown**: Type, location, severity, description, date/time
5. **Organization can**:
   - View full details
   - Edit to update status
   - Add resolution notes
   - Mark as resolved/closed

### Tab Usage:
- **All Incidents**: Overview of everything
- **Hiker Reports**: Focus on community-reported issues (requires immediate attention)
