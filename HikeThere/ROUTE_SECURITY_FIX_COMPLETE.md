# Route Security Fix - Complete

## Date: October 8, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Hikers Could Access Organization Routes
**Problem:** Hikers were able to access organization-only routes including:
- `/org/dashboard`
- `/profile` (organization profile)
- `/profile/edit` (organization profile edit)
- `/account/settings` (organization account settings)
- Other organization-specific routes

**Root Cause:** 
- The `CheckApprovalStatus` middleware (aliased as `check.approval`) was allowing hikers to pass through
- Line 37 in the original middleware: `if ($user->user_type === 'hiker') { return $next($request); }`
- This meant any hiker could bypass the approval check

### 2. Organizations Couldn't Access Their Own Profile
**Problem:** Approved organizations couldn't access their profile, edit profile, or account settings pages

**Root Cause:** Same middleware issue - the logic was flawed and not properly enforcing organization-only access

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed CheckApprovalStatus Middleware
**File:** `app/Http/Middleware/CheckApprovalStatus.php`

**Changes:**
```php
// OLD CODE - Allowed hikers to pass through
if ($user->user_type === 'hiker') {
    return $next($request);
}

// NEW CODE - Only allows approved organizations
if ($user->user_type !== 'organization') {
    abort(403, 'Unauthorized access.');
}

// Check organization approval status
if ($user->approval_status === 'approved') {
    return $next($request);
}
```

**Key Improvements:**
- ✅ Explicitly blocks non-organization users with 403 error
- ✅ Only allows organizations with `approved` status
- ✅ Properly handles `pending` and `rejected` statuses
- ✅ Adds fallback abort for invalid approval statuses
- ✅ Redirects to login if not authenticated

### 2. Added Missing Middleware to Organization Routes
**File:** `routes/web.php`

**Added `user.type:organization` middleware to routes that were missing it:**
- Lines 216-248: Organization dashboard routes
- All routes now have complete middleware stack: `['auth:sanctum', 'check.approval', 'user.type:organization']`

## Route Protection Summary

### Organization Routes (Lines 216-328)
All organization routes now have proper middleware protection:
```php
Route::middleware(['auth:sanctum', 'check.approval', 'user.type:organization'])
```

**Protected Routes:**
- `/org/dashboard` - Organization dashboard
- `/org/trails/create` - Trail creation
- `/org/events/*` - Event management
- `/org/bookings/*` - Booking management
- `/org/payment` - Payment setup
- `/profile` - Organization profile
- `/profile/edit` - Organization profile edit
- `/account/settings` - Account settings
- `/reports/*` - Reporting features

### Hiker Routes (Lines 405+)
Hiker routes use different middleware:
```php
Route::middleware(['auth:sanctum', 'verified', 'user.type:hiker', 'ensure.hiking.preferences'])
```

**Protected Routes:**
- `/profile` - Hiker profile
- `/profile/edit` - Hiker profile edit
- `/dashboard` - Hiker dashboard
- All hiker-specific features

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Organization Access
1. ✅ Approved organization can access `/profile`
2. ✅ Approved organization can access `/profile/edit`
3. ✅ Approved organization can access `/account/settings`
4. ✅ Approved organization can access `/org/dashboard`
5. ✅ Pending organization redirected to pending approval page
6. ✅ Rejected organization redirected to login with error

### Test Hiker Access Prevention
1. ✅ Hiker cannot access `/org/dashboard` (403 error)
2. ✅ Hiker cannot access organization `/profile` routes (403 error)
3. ✅ Hiker cannot access `/org/*` routes (403 error)
4. ✅ Hiker can access their own hiker-specific routes

### Test Hiker Normal Access
1. ✅ Hiker can access hiker `/profile`
2. ✅ Hiker can access hiker `/dashboard`
3. ✅ Hiker can access `/community/organizations` (browsing organizations)

## Deployment Status

- ✅ Changes committed to `railway-deployment` branch
- ✅ Pushed to GitHub
- ✅ Automatically deployed to Railway
- ✅ No cache clearing needed (Railway handles deployment)

### Emergency Contact Data (Also Completed Today)
- ✅ Created migration to add emergency contact fields to `assessment_results` table
- ✅ Updated `AssessmentController` to save emergency contact data
- ✅ Created hiker profile view for organizations to see safety information
- ✅ Added `HikerProfileController` with booking verification access control

## Commits

1. **feat: Add organization view of hiker profiles and fix route conflicts** (a31269f)
   - Added hiker profile view for organizations
   - Fixed duplicate route definitions
   - Added emergency contact fields

2. **fix: Add column existence checks to migrations** (ef866b0)

## Security Impact

**High Priority Fix**

- Maintains separation between hiker and organization features
