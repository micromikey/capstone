## Technical Implementation

### Controller Logic
```php

$trailIds = Trail::where('user_id', $user->id)->pluck('id');

// Collect various activities
$recentActivity = collect()
    ->merge($recentTrails)
    ->merge($recentEvents)
    ->merge($recentBookings)
    ->merge($recentFeedback)
    ->merge($recentIncidents)
    ->sortByDesc('timestamp')
    ->take(10);
```

### Data Structure
Each activity item contains:
```php
[
    'type' => 'activity_type',
    'icon' => 'icon_name',
    'title' => 'Activity Title',
    'description' => 'Detailed description',
    'timestamp' => Carbon instance,
    'color' => 'tailwind_color'
]
```
