# Payment Method Toggle Implementation

## Overview
Added a toggle switch on the organization payment setup page that allows organizations to choose between Manual Payment (QR Code) and Automatic Payment (Gateway). Hikers are automatically directed to the appropriate payment method based on the organization's preference.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Toggle Switch UI** (`resources/views/org/payment/index.blade.php`)
- Beautiful animated toggle switch in a gradient card
- Shows current payment method status
- Real-time visual feedback with icons and labels
- Color-coded: Orange for Manual, Green for Automatic
- Status message explaining what hikers will see

### 2. **Backend Route** (`routes/web.php`)
- Added new route: `PUT /org/payment/toggle-method`
- Route name: `org.payment.toggle-method`
- Protected by authentication and organization middleware

### 3. **Controller Method** (`app/Http/Controllers/OrganizationPaymentController.php`)
- `togglePaymentMethod()` method handles the toggle
- Updates `payment_method` field in `OrganizationPaymentCredential`
- Logs the change for tracking
- Returns success message to user

### 4. **Payment Method Detection** (Already Working)
- API endpoint: `GET /api/trail/{trailId}/payment-method`
- Returns organization's payment preference
- Hikers' booking page automatically adjusts based on response

## How It Works

### Organization Side:
1. Organization navigates to Payment Setup page
2. Sees prominent toggle switch at the top
3. Can switch between Manual and Automatic payment methods
4. Toggle submits form immediately on change
5. Page refreshes with success message
6. Active payment method is displayed

### Hiker Side (Already Implemented):
1. Hiker selects a trail on booking page
2. JavaScript calls `/api/trail/{trailId}/payment-method`
3. Response includes:
   - `payment_method`: 'manual' or 'automatic'
   - `has_qr_code`: boolean
   - `qr_code_url`: URL if manual payment
   - `payment_instructions`: optional instructions

4. **If Manual Payment:**
   - Shows QR code image
   - Shows payment instructions
   - Requires payment proof upload
   - Requires transaction number
   - Sets `payment_method` hidden field to 'manual'

5. **If Automatic Payment:**
   - Shows message about redirect
   - Hides QR code section
   - Sets `payment_method` hidden field to 'automatic'
   - Payment proof and transaction not required

## Database Field
- Table: `organization_payment_credentials`
- Column: `payment_method`
- Values: 'manual' or 'automatic'
- Default: 'manual'

## Visual Design

### Toggle Switch States:
- **Manual (OFF)**: 
  - Background: Orange (#f59e0b)
  - Icon: QR Code
  - Position: Left
  
- **Automatic (ON)**: 
  - Background: Green (#10b981)
  - Icon: Credit Card
  - Position: Right

### Status Messages:
- Manual: "Hikers will see your QR code and upload payment proof during checkout."
- Automatic: "Hikers will be directed to the payment gateway to complete their booking."
