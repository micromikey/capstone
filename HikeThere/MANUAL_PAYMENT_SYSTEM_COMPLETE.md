# Manual Payment System - Complete Implementation

## Overview
A comprehensive manual payment system allowing organizations to accept payments via QR codes, alongside the existing automatic payment gateway. The system features a two-tab interface where Manual Payment is the default/recommended option (left tab) and Automatic Payment gateway is in Beta (right tab).

## System Architecture

### Payment Flow
```
1. Organization Setup (Manual Payment - Recommended)
   → Upload QR code
   → Add payment instructions
   → System stores in database and storage

2. Hiker Booking Flow
   → Select trail
   → View QR code (if manual payment)
   → Make payment via QR
   → Upload payment proof + transaction number
   → Submit booking

3. Organization Verification Flow
   → View pending verifications (dashboard card)
   → Review payment proof image
   → Verify or Reject payment
   → System updates booking status

4. Hiker Status Updates
   → Pending: "Payment Pending Verification"
   → Verified: "Payment Verified - Booking Confirmed!"
   → Rejected: "Payment Rejected - Action Required" + Resubmit button
```

## Database Schema

## Routes

```php
// Organization Payment Setup
Route::put('/org/payment/manual', [OrganizationPaymentController::class, 'updateManual'])
    ->name('org.payment.update-manual');

// API - Payment Method Detection
Route::get('/api/trail/{trail}/payment-method', [Api\TrailController::class, 'getPaymentMethod'])
    ->name('api.trail.payment-method');

// Organization Booking Verification
Route::post('/org/bookings/{booking}/verify-payment', [OrganizationBookingController::class, 'verifyPayment'])
    ->name('org.bookings.verify-payment');

```

## Storage Configuration

### QR Codes
- **Path**: `storage/app/public/qr_codes/`
- **Naming**: `{org_id}_{timestamp}.{extension}`
- **Access**: `asset('storage/qr_codes/{filename}')`
- **Auto-cleanup**: Old QR code deleted when new one uploaded

### Payment Proofs

## Validation Rules

### QR Code Upload
```php
'qr_code' => 'required|image|mimes:jpeg,png,gif|max:10240'
'manual_payment_instructions' => 'required|string'
```

## Troubleshooting

### QR Code Not Displaying
- Run `php artisan storage:link`
- Check file permissions on `storage/app/public/`
- Verify qr_code_path in database

### Payment Proof Upload Fails
- Check `upload_max_filesize` in php.ini (should be > 10MB)
- Verify `storage/app/public/payment_proofs/` directory exists and is writable
- Check `post_max_size` in php.ini

### Verification Buttons Not Working
- Check routes are registered: `php artisan route:list | grep verify-payment`
- Verify CSRF token in forms
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### Count Not Updating
- Clear cache: `php artisan cache:clear`
- Check query in OrganizationBookingController::index()
- Verify payment_method_used and payment_status columns exist

## Future Enhancements
1. **Email Notifications**: Notify hikers when payment verified/rejected
2. **Rejection Reason**: Allow org to provide reason when rejecting
3. **Multiple QR Codes**: Support different payment providers
4. **Payment Analytics**: Track manual vs automatic payment success rates
5. **Bulk Verification**: Select multiple pending payments to verify at once
