# Organization Search Feature - Complete Implementation

## Overview
Added a comprehensive search functionality for organization users, similar to the hiker's search feature. Organizations can now search through their trails, events, and bookings directly from the dashboard header.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Frontend UI
**File**: `resources/views/org/dashboard.blade.php`
- Added search bar to header slot with responsive flex layout
- Includes search input field with icon
- Submit button styled with organization theme colors (#336d66, #20b6d2)
- Placeholder text: "Search trails, events, bookings..."

**File**: `resources/views/partials/org-search-dropdown.blade.php`
- Dropdown container for displaying search results
- Positioned absolutely below search input
- Max height with scrollable overflow
- Styled with white background and shadow

### 2. Backend API
**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/SearchController.php`
- Added `orgSearch()` method to handle organization-specific searches
- Searches across three entity types:
  - **Trails**: Searches trail_name and mountain_name
  - **Events**: Searches event_name and description
  - **Bookings**: Searches booking_id and related user info
- Implements weighted scoring system:
  - Trails: weight 3
  - Events: weight 3
  - Bookings: weight 2
- Returns top 10 results with type, title, subtitle, URL, and ID

**File**: `routes/api.php`
- Added `/api/org-search` endpoint with auth middleware
- Ensures only authenticated organization users can search

**File**: `routes/web.php`
- Added `/org/search` route for search results page
- Added SearchController import

### 3. JavaScript Module
**File**: `resources/js/org-search.js`
- Debounced search with 300ms delay
- Real-time dropdown results as user types
- Keyboard navigation support:
  - Arrow Down/Up: Navigate results
  - Enter: Open selected result
  - Escape: Close dropdown
- Visual feedback with highlighting
- Type-specific Font Awesome icons:
  - Trail: fa-hiking (green)
  - Event: fa-calendar (blue)
  - Booking: fa-clipboard-list (indigo)
- Accessible with ARIA attributes

**File**: `resources/js/app.js`
- Added import for org-search module

## Search Features

### Scoring Algorithm
The search uses a sophisticated scoring system that considers:
1. **Exact substring matches**: +50 points
2. **Prefix matches**: +20 bonus points
3. **Subtitle matches**: +15 points
4. **Fuzzy matching**: Levenshtein distance (up to +10 points)
5. **Length normalization**: Shorter titles score higher
6. **Entity weight**: Different weights for different entity types

### Results Display
- Shows up to 10 results
- Grouped by relevance score
- Each result shows:
  - Icon indicating type
  - Title (highlighted match)
  - Subtitle with contextual info
  - Clickable link to edit/view page

### User Experience
- Instant feedback as user types
- No page reload required
- Click outside to close dropdown
- Mobile responsive
- Accessible for screen readers

## Routes Added
1. **API Route**: `GET /api/org-search` - Returns JSON results
2. **Web Route**: `GET /org/search` - Search results page (fallback)

## Security
- API endpoint protected with `auth` middleware
- Only returns results for current organization's content
- User authentication verified on every request
